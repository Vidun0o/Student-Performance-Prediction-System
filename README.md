A data science project built with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to predict student success. The system analyzes the relationship between study hours and marks, using a Logistic Regression model to classify whether a student will pass or fail. It includes data cleaning, Matplotlib visualizations, and Power BI dashboards to help track performance trends and make data-driven predictions.
